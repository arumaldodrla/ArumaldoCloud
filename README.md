# Arumaldo Cloud

## The AI-Powered Digital Infrastructure Operating System

**Arumaldo Cloud** is a unified, AI-powered, security-first platform that provides Website-as-a-Service (WaaS) with integrated DNS management, security, and compliance. It combines the capabilities of ArumaldoWaaS (AI-powered WordPress website creation) and SafeOrbit (DNS and web security) into a single, cohesive offering.

> **"The most secure websites in the world, created in minutes, compliant everywhere."**
